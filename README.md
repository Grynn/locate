locate (whereis)
======

Locate is a very fast way to search for files with names matching those specified on the command line. 
It relies on Windows Search and hence does not duplicate indexing effort (which would otherwise slow down your computer). 

Example usage: `c:\>locate trek` 

Returns a list of files matching "*trek*".
